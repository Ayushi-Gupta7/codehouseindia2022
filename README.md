# VMware CodeHouse India 2022

This document will serve as guidance for attendees and mentors of VMware CodeHouse India 2022. The theme for this year's CodeHouse is based on DE&I.

Diversity is imperative to create and sustain innovative organizations. Women unable to continue with their careers due to several reasons end up taking a break. 
How can we make these women come back to workforce after the break? How can we make them employable in the fast-changing technological world?  How can we help organizations recruit for their programs focusing on returnship? How can we leverage technology to train and connect these women to the right upskilling platforms and job opportunities? Via this hackathon, the participants will develop a solution to connect promising women candidates who have taken a career break, to job opportunities and access to technical mentorship programs.
